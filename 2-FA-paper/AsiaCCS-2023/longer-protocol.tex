\section{More Enhanced Protocol}\label{sec::more-enhanced}

In this section, we present a more enhanced version of the protocol that we presented in Section \ref{sec::the-protocol}. The proposed protocol ensures that even if an adversary penetrates the server and accesses the server's local data, it cannot authenticate itself to the server later on and as before it cannot learn users' PIN.  

We present the new versions of the setup, enrolment and authentication phases in Figures \ref{fig:setup-long}, \ref{fig:enrollment-long}, and \ref{fig:auth-long}. We have highlighted the new steps in blue.
