\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this work, we have presented a 2FA protocol that resists a strong adversary who may (a) observe the traffic between a user and server, and (b) have physical access to the userâ€™s hardware token, or its PIN, or breach the server. Our protocol offers a unique combination of key features that state-of-the-art schemes do not. Specifically,  our protocol (i) requires a user to remember only one secret/PIN, (ii) is based on only symmetric-key primitives, (iii) is in a standard model, (iv) does not assume the user's computer is trusted, and (v) imposes low communication costs.

This is the first protocol that offers the aforementioned features without requiring tamper-resistant hardware. 

Future research could investigate the \emph{usability} of a hardware token that embeds our 2FA protocol. Exploring the utilisation of hardware tokens for granting computation within the delegated computation research field is also an intriguing avenue of study.
