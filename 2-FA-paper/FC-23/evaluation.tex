\section{Evaluation}\label{sec::eval}
\vspace{-2mm}

In this section, we briefly analyse and compare our 2FA protocol with the smart-card-based protocol proposed in  \cite{WangW18} and the hardware token-based protocol in \cite{JareckiJKSS21} as the latter two protocols are relatively efficient, do not use secure chipsets, and they consider the same security threats as we do. We summarise the analysis result in Table \ref{comparisonTable}. We refer readers to Appendix \ref{sec::long-eval} for a more detailed evaluation. 

%Before we compare the two protocols' costs, we highlight a vital difference between the two.

\subsection{Computation Cost}
%\vspace{-2mm}

In our protocol, each party (client or server) invokes the authenticated encryption scheme $4$ times and the pseudorandom function $5$ times. In the protocol proposed in \cite{WangW18}, the client invokes a hash function $11$ times and performs $3$ modular exponentiations while the server invokes the hash function $8$ times and performs $2$ modular exponentiations. Moreover, in the protocol presented in \cite{JareckiJKSS21}, the client invokes a hash function $3$ times and runs symmetric key encryption once. It also performs $10$ modular exponentiations. While the server invokes a pseudorandom function once and performs at least $2$ modular exponentiations and $2$ symmetric-key encryptions. Thus,  our protocol and the ones in \cite{WangW18,JareckiJKSS21} involve a constant number of symmetric key primitive invocations; however, our protocol does not involve any modular exponentiations, whereas those in  \cite{WangW18,JareckiJKSS21} involve a constant number of modular exponentiations which leads to a higher cost.

\subsection{Communication Cost}
\vspace{-2mm}

In our protocol, the communication cost of the client is $1268$ bits and the server is $1536$ bits. However, in the protocol proposed in \cite{WangW18},  the communication cost of the client is $1952$ bits and the server is  $1184$ bits; while in the protocol developed in \cite{JareckiJKSS21} the client's and server's communication costs are at least $2856$ and $1044$ bits respectively. Hence, our protocol imposes $10\%$ and $40\%$ lower communication costs than the protocols in \cite{WangW18} and \cite{JareckiJKSS21} do respectively.

\subsection{Other Features}
\vspace{-2mm}
 In our protocol, a client needs to know only a single secret, i.e., a  PIN. Nevertheless, in the protocol in \cite{WangW18}, a client has to know an additional secret, i.e., a random ID. As shown in \cite{Scott12a}, the scheme in \cite{WangW18} will not remain secure, even if only the client's ID is revealed. The protocol in \cite{JareckiJKSS21} requires the client (in addition to remembering its PIN) to locally store a cryptographic secret key of sufficient length, e.g., $128$ bits; this secret key must not be kept on the device. 
 % 
 Furthermore, our protocol is secure in the standard model while the protocols in \cite{WangW18,JareckiJKSS21} are in the non-standard random oracle model.
