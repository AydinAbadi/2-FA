\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}

In this section, we briefly analyse and compare our 2FA protocol with the smart-card-based protocol proposed in  \cite{WangW18} and the hardware token-based protocol in \cite{JareckiJKSS21} as the latter two protocols are relatively efficient, do not use secure chipsets, and they consider the same security threats as we do. We summarise the analysis result in Table \ref{comparisonTable}. We refer readers to \prettyref{app:long-eval} for a more detailed evaluation. 

%Before we compare the two protocols' costs, we highlight a vital difference between the two. 




\input{evaluation-table}

\subsection{Computation Cost}

In our protocol, each party (user or server) invokes the authenticated encryption scheme $4$ times and the pseudorandom function $5$ times. In the protocol proposed by Wang \etal~\cite{WangW18}, the user invokes a hash function $11$ times and performs $3$ modular exponentiations while the server invokes the hash function $8$ times and performs $2$ modular exponentiations. Moreover, in the protocol presented by Jarecki \etal~\cite{JareckiJKSS21}, the user invokes a hash function $3$ times and runs symmetric key encryption once. It also performs $10$ modular exponentiations. While the server invokes a pseudorandom function once and performs at least $2$ modular exponentiations and $2$ symmetric-key encryptions. Thus,  our protocol and the ones in \cite{WangW18,JareckiJKSS21} involve a constant number of symmetric key primitive invocations; however, our protocol does not involve any modular exponentiations, whereas those in  \cite{WangW18,JareckiJKSS21} involve a constant number of modular exponentiations which leads to a higher cost. 

\subsection{Communication Cost}

In our protocol, the communication cost of the user is $1268$ bits and the server is $1536$ bits. However, in the protocol proposed in \cite{WangW18},  the communication cost of the user is $1952$ bits and the server is  $1184$ bits; while in the protocol developed in \cite{JareckiJKSS21} the user's and server's communication costs are at least $2856$ and $1044$ bits respectively. Hence, our protocol imposes $10\%$ and $40\%$ lower communication costs than the protocols in \cite{WangW18} and \cite{JareckiJKSS21} do respectively.


\subsection{Other Features}

 In our protocol, a user needs to know and insert into the device only a single secret, \ie, a  PIN. In contrast, in the protocol in \cite{WangW18}, a user has to know and insert an additional secret, \ie, a random ID. As shown by Scott~\cite{Scott12a}, the scheme in \cite{WangW18} will not remain secure, even if only the user's ID is revealed. The protocol in \cite{JareckiJKSS21} requires the user (in addition to remembering its PIN) to locally store a cryptographic secret key of sufficient length, \eg, $128$ bits; this secret key must not be kept on the device but must be inserted into it during the authentication phase. 
 % 
 Furthermore, our protocol is secure in the standard model whereas the protocols in \cite{WangW18,JareckiJKSS21} are in the non-standard random oracle model.
