\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

\vspace{-2mm}

In this paper, we have presented an efficient 2FA protocol that resists a strong adversary who may (a) observe the traffic between a client and server, and (b) have physical access to the clientâ€™s device, or its PIN, or breach the server. Our protocol offers a unique combination of key features that state-of-the-art schemes do not. Specifically,  our protocol (i) requires a client to remember only one secret/PIN, (ii) is based on only symmetric key primitives, (iii) is in a standard model, and (iv) imposes low communication costs. This is the first protocol that offers the aforementioned features without using any trusted chipsets. Future research could investigate the usability of a hardware token that embeds our 2FA protocol.
